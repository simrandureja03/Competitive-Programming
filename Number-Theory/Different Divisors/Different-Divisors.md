1. Different Divisors(B)

# Description
A positive integer x is called a divisor of y if y is divisible by x without remainder.

You are given an integer d. Find the smallest positive integer a such that:
- a has at least 4 divisors
- the difference between any two divisors of a is at least d

# Input
- The first line contains an integer t — number of test cases
- Each test case contains a single integer d

# Output
For each test case, print one integer a.

### Sample
Input:
2
