### 1️⃣ Fork the Repository 🍴
Click the **Fork** button on GitHub to create your own copy of this repository.

---

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository 🖥️
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
````

---

### 3️⃣ Create a New Branch 🌿

Create a separate branch for your feature or solution:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

📌 Example:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-greedy-solutions
```

---

### 4️⃣ Add Your Solution 📄

* Navigate to the **appropriate topic/question folder** (e.g., `graphs/`, `arrays/`).
* Add your solution file using the naming convention below:

```
githubUsername--questionName.extension
```

📌 Example:

```
johnDoe--Q11.RotateImage.cpp
```

✅ Ensure that:

* Your solution is **correct, optimized, and readable**
* Best coding practices are followed
* Comments are added where logic is non-trivial
* Files are added **only inside the relevant question folder**
* No files are added to the root directory

---

### 5️⃣ Push Changes & Create a Pull Request 🔄

* Push your changes to your forked repository
* Open a **Pull Request (PR)** to the main repository
* Maintainers will review your PR and request changes if needed
* Once approved, your PR will be merged 🎉

---

## 🧩 Issue Assignment Rules

* Each problem/issue will have **a maximum of 3–5 contributors**
* Please **do not start working** on an issue unless you are assigned
* This avoids duplicate work and ensures smooth collaboration

---

## 🧪 Solution & Language Guidelines

* Each question can have **only ONE merged solution per language**:

  * **C++**
  * **Java**
  * **Python**
* If a solution already exists for a language:

  * Review it
  * Suggest improvements instead of submitting duplicates

---

## 📁 Folder Structure (MANDATORY)

All merged solutions **must be inside the specific question folder**.

❌ Do not create unnecessary folders
❌ Do not place files in the root directory

📂 Example structure:

```
/Arrays/
 └── Two_Sum/
     ├── solution.cpp
     ├── solution.java
     └── solution.py
```

---

## 🔍 Pull Request Review & Merging

* PRs are reviewed for:

  * Correctness
  * Code quality and readability
  * Proper folder structure
  * Naming conventions
* Only one solution per language will be merged
* PRs not following guidelines may be requested for changes or closed

---

## ✅ Closing Issues

* Once:

  * all assigned contributors have completed their work, and
  * valid solutions have been merged,
* The corresponding **GitHub issue will be closed**

---

## 🎯 General Contributor Guidelines

* ✔️ Submit **unique and optimized** solutions only
